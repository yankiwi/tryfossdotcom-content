Welcome to my blog, I'm Paddy and this is where I'll be sharing my journey of discovering and using open source software in my everyday life. From automating tasks around my home to streamlining work processes, I'm on a bit of a mission to show off the power and versatility of open source technology. Join me as I document my projects and explore the vast landscape of open source software, and look for opportunities to contribute back to the projects I use.
